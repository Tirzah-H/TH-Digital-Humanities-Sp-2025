<h1> Alan Turing </h1>
<h2> The Father of Computer Theory </h2>
<p> Alan Turing was a British computer scientist who created the Turing Machine, a predecessor to modern computers. It used the same logical principles of modern digital computers. He also coined the Turing Test, which states that if a computer can fool a human into thinking they are speaking to a human instead of a computer, then the computer is intelligent. </p>
<p> During WWII, Turing aided the allies in deciphering encoded transmissions from the Nazis. For this, he was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE). </p>
<h2> Homophobia </h2>
<p> Turing was homosexual, which was illegal in the UK through the 1950s. After the war, he was charged with gross indecency for having a sexual relationship with a man. His security clearance was removed and he was forced to choose between prison and hormonal treatment. After two years, Turing died of cyanide poisoning, debatably a suicide.</p>
